A little bit about myself

Hi there, I'm Petar!

I am a parttime Field Engineer and Student at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences studying Cyber Security.
In my free time I like to poke arround devices, find information abou the latest technology and having a drink with friends.
When it comes to technology, my curiosity truely seems to have no limits. I just love to learn about it!

I'll use github for school projects and personal projects.
